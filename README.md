## Future Enhancements

1. **Handle new items after sorting**: Currently, the behavior when a user adds an item after the grocery items have been sorted is not defined. This needs to be handled in a future update.

2. **Save and reset sorted lists**: The application should be able to save sorted lists for future reference. Additionally, the sorted list should be reset anytime a new item is added to ensure the list remains sorted.

3. **Toggle between general and sorted lists**: A feature could be added to allow users to toggle between viewing a general list and a sorted list. This would give users more flexibility in how they view their grocery items.
