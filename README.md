## Description

A spin on a classic grocery list application, [try it here](https://effulgent-praline-4dbf11.netlify.app/), Grocery Pal allows users to categorize their list using a Text Model (AI) [GPT 3.5 Turbo-infused API I built](https://github.com/fidotheprince/dynamic-shopping-api). This application is perfect for users who want to keep their grocery list organized and sorted by category.

Accordingly, this application will automatically sort the list by category and display the sorted list to the user. The text model in the backend will classify any set of items you submit to your list. 

You're also able to print out your list and take it with to the store, or send it to a loved one to pick up the items for you, by downloading a PDF of your list.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of this repository. If you're not sure what the URL is, you can find it by clicking the 'Code' button on the repository page.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer or by entering the file URL in your web browser's address bar. The file URL should look something like this:

```
file:///path/to/your/project-directory/index.html
```
Replace `/path/to/your/project-directory` with the actual path to the project directory.

That's it! You should now be able to use the application in your web browser.

You can also use the `Live Server` extension in Visual Studio Code to run the project in your browser. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.

Please replace `<repository-url>` and `<project-directory>` with the actual repository URL and project directory name.
